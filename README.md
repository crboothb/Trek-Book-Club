# Trek-Book_Club
An exploration of the vote-based book rankings for the novels read in #TrekBookClub.

All visualizations will be conducted in RStudio.
Finished visualizations will be available in an annotated .Rmd file, and available as .png images

Work in progress:
Proposed visualizations:
* time-series plot of the number of votes cast in ranking the novels over time
* plot of each of each novel's popularity by number of votes corrected against the general growth in the #TrekBookClub community
* stacked bar graphs of the proportion of each rating for the novels. This approach sees the vote for a letter grade as likert-scale data.
* stacked bar graphs of the proportion of each rating for the novels, all faceted by series.
* plot of average score of each novel, when each vote for an A, B, C, or D, is counted as 3,2,1, and 0 respectively. Inclusion of some indication of the number of votes cast for normalization purposes--> Do these averages capture enough information about how the community felt about each novel? Reflect on whether there is info in the stacked bar, that doesn't show up in the averages.
* plot of average score of novel against publication date. Is this a productive variable?
* plot of average score of novel against number of pages. Is this a productive variable?
