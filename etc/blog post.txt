#TrekBookClub Exploratory Visualizations!

one year later...

What is Trek Book Club
	generally, it's a positive space on Twitter for the overlap in the venn diagram of book enthusiasts and Star Trek enthusiasts. 
	We are trekkies who have been reading and watching star trek since childhood, people who've only gotten into trek in the past few years, people who know every detail of trivia, and people who know the main characters and some episodes and that's it and everything in between. We're from several different countries. This also means that the club runs from... 3 or 4 AM my time all the way into the night in long, fun marathons.
	Personally, I've liked and watched Star Trek TNG since college, but I've only seen the other series in the past few years, when I met Gregg. Before TrekBookClub, I'd never picked up a Star Trek novel. I'm also not entirely sure I would without the club, but who knows! As it is, a trek book a month on top of my other obligations is probably more than enough

From the beginning, @TrekkieRob has been gathering the stats from each of #TrekBookClub's polls, and it's all freely available here. 

Since I had some time and was curious, I've made some visualizations of this data!

[Series_count.png] Most of the novels we've read are companions to specific Star Trek Series. Apparently we LOVE Deep Space Nine. Of the 24 novels we've discussed, almost a third have been DS9 spin-offs. Hey, and this month, we're reading Una McCormick's Hollow Men, which is another DS9 novel set during the Dominion war.

We end each book club with a poll where participants rate the novel with a letter grade.

[voter_time_DSC] If we take the number of voters in the wrap-up polls as a proxy for people who participate in #TrekBookClub, whether as discussants or readers, we can also track the growth in the community. (The line is a best-fit linear smoother)

[voter_time_DSC][The Way to the Stars cover] But really strikingly, The Discovery novels consistently outperform the typical pattern of growth, attracting many more participants than usual! The novel that drew the greatest numbers was @unamccormack 's The Way to the Stars

[title_average_score_stacked] But the next question probably is: Which novels did #TrekBookClub like the best?
In the closing polls @TrekkieRob set up, participants voted to assign the novels a letter grade. Based on the closing percentages, I've got stacked bar charts showing these proportions.

[title_average_score_stacked] In the graph, the titles are ordered by average score (a weighted average generated by making A=3,B=2,C=1,D=0), so by reading the titles from top to bottom, we get a ranking of the #TrekBookClub novels we've read.

Sooo, according to these methods, the top 5 #TrekBookClub novels are:
*The Never-Ending Sacrifice
*Desperate Hours 
*Articles of the Federation
*A Stitch in Time
*The Way to the Stars
*Cough* @unamccormack is on here twice

[Title_average_score] We can also look at the average scores on their own. There are so many DS9 books, that we have scores all across the spectrum. It's also cool to note that all the DSC novels have above average scores.

But when we take the number of votes for each grade into account, a few different novels start to stand out. Way to the Stars looks particularly impressive (more As than any other novel), and Voyager: Mosaic doesn't look too shabby either!

I'm calling this next section the Appendix, because it's all the things that had no effect, but I had to check anyway

Hey, have you wondered if the number of voters affects the distribution of grades? Say, if a poll gets a lot of exposure do people just hit A as they scroll by?
Turns out this isn't a problem!

I also gathered the publication dates for the novels we've read, but there aren't enough for the distribution to look that nice (maybe this should be a KDE instead of a histogram). But hey, shoutout to the early 2000s!

When choosing the next novel we read, sometimes we vote and sometimes @TrekkieRob or a Patreon gets to pick. There is very little to no difference in average score for selected vs. voted in novels. 

When comparing the number of participants for selected vs. voted novels, it initially looks like the selected novels have a steeper positive slope, but I think that's more the effect of Una's outlier in the selected group.

I also checked for a correlations between score and novel length (in number of pages) or publication date, but those looked so unimpressive they weren't worth publishing.

Anyway, let me know if you any questions about any of these graphs. All the code is also freely available on Github
